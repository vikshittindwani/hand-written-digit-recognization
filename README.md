# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high accuracy on digit classification.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a model that can accurately classify grayscale images of handwritten digits. This is a classic beginner-friendly deep learning project that's great for learning image processing and neural network fundamentals.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** MNIST Handwritten Digits
- **Source:** [MNIST on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) or directly via `keras.datasets.mnist`
- **Details:**
  - 60,000 training images
  - 10,000 test images
  - Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Conv2D + ReLU
  - MaxPooling2D
  - Flatten
  - Dense Layers
  - Softmax for multi-class classification
